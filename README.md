# Item Manager App

This lightweight fullstack app uses FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend, allowing users to easily add, view, and delete items from an in-memory database. 
Axios is used on the frontend to send HTTP requests to the backend, while FastAPIâ€™s CORSMiddleware ensures these requests are accepted safely across different origins. 
Together, they enable smooth communication between the frontend and backend without any cross-origin errors.
